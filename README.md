# Simple 2D Platformer movemement script
A Player movement script which I programmed and was inspired by Bendux
This is a movement script I have created using Microsoft Visual studio and Unity to install it all youll need to do is this:
1) Add a Ground Layer and tag the flooring as this
2) On the Player drag the player rigidbody into the rigidbody section of the script
3) Click the ground layer and apply it to the script
4) Drag the players groundcheck and add it into the transform section of the script
Credits to Bendux for help with the script his channel is: https://www.youtube.com/@bendux
